# Take A Break

We've reached Q4 of another year, and after the mad scramble that has been crunch-time over the past few weeks, it's time for SGC to once again retire into a deep, restful sleep.

2025 saw a lot of ground covered:
* NVK-Zink synergy
* Continued Rusticl improvements
* Viewperf perf and general CPU overhead reduction
* Tiler GPU perf
* Mesh shaders
* apitrace perf
* More GL extensions released than any other year this decade

It's been a real roller coaster ride of a year as always, but I can say authoritatively that fans of the blog, you need to take care of yourselves. You need to use this break time wisely. Rest. Recover. Train your bodies. Travel and broaden your horizons. Invest in night classes to expand your minds.

You are not prepared for the insanity that will be this blog in 2026.
